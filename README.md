# Tangaria

Tangaria – free open-source multiplayer roguelike game loosely based on Tolkien’s lore and powered by [PWMAngband](https://github.com/draconisPW/PWMAngband).

It combines the complexity and unpredictability of **roguelike genre** and social features of **MMORPG**: kill monsters together with your friends, chat, PvP (on demand), buy a house and open a store to trade your goods with other players… with advanced real-time gameplay – game become semi turn-based when your character is injured.
